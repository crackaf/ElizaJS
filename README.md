# ELIZA-JS
ELIZA is an early natural language processing(NLP) computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum in SLIP language. This is the javascript version written by Michal Wallace and George Dunlop in about 1997.

This repo is cloned from http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm. Little changes are made in modern javascript.
